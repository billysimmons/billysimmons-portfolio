      <p class="text-lg mb-4">
        During my placement at Gilmour Space, I was immersed in a dynamic
        environment focused on Vue application development. This experience
        provided a unique platform to apply and enhance both technical and
        transferable skills that are paramount in the software development
        industry.

            Technical Skills and Knowledge Developed: Firstly, I significantly
            enhanced my proficiency in Vue.js, a front-end JavaScript framework.
            Through hands-on projects, I gained a deep understanding of
            component-based architecture, state management, and routing. This
            experience expanded my ability to develop responsive and interactive
            user interfaces, a crucial skill in modern web development.
            Additionally, I delved into debugging complex code, allowing me to
            identify and resolve issues efficiently. This refined my
            problem-solving skills and equipped me with the ability to tackle
            intricate challenges in a production environment. Moreover, I had
            the opportunity to engage with Git version control extensively,
            gaining proficiency in collaborative code management and version
            tracking.

            Prescribed and Self-Identified Learning: The industry partner
            provided structured learning on optimising code for performance,
            which was critical for enhancing the efficiency of our Vue
            application. Additionally, I identified the need to deepen my
            knowledge in asynchronous JavaScript and gained proficiency in
            handling asynchronous operations through asynchronous functions and
            Promises. The depth and breadth of my learning during this placement
            were extensive. Not only did I develop a strong foundation in
            Vue.js, but I also acquired advanced skills in debugging and
            asynchronous JavaScript as a result. This comprehensive skill set
            enabled me to contribute effectively to the development team and
            deliver high-quality code.

            Application of Existing Skill Set to a Different Context: This
            experience represented an application of my existing JavaScript
            knowledge to a more specialized context. While I had prior
            experience with JavaScript, the intricacies of Vue.js required a
            deeper understanding of front-end development. This transition was
            marked by an increased focus on component-based architecture and
            reactivity, areas that were more nuanced in Vue.js compared to
            traditional JavaScript. Approach to Learning: As an undergraduate
            student, my approach to learning was primarily centered around
            coursework and theoretical understanding. However, as a
            post-graduate student and through this placement, my approach
            evolved to prioritize practical application and hands-on experience.
            I recognized the significance of continuous learning in staying
            current with industry trends and emerging technologies. Selected
            Critical Transferable Skills: Teamwork and Communication Throughout
            my academic journey, the emphasis on teamwork has transformed from
            group projects to collaborative coding sessions. This shift has
            honed my ability to effectively communicate ideas, delegate tasks,
            and coordinate efforts within a team.
