The project involved designing an interactive user interface for a data visualization tool. As I delved into the development process, I became aware of the potential implications of displaying complex data in a simplified, user-friendly manner. This raised concerns about the responsible use of data and the potential for misinterpretation by end-users. To address this, I took a proactive approach. I initiated discussions with the project lead and data analysts to gain a deeper understanding of the data being presented. This allowed me to appreciate the nuances and complexities, reinforcing the need for accurate representation. In collaboration with the data team, we implemented features like tooltips and contextual information pop-ups to provide users with additional context and prevent misinterpretation. Additionally, we incorporated clear labeling and visual cues to guide users in their interactions with the data. While these measures were essential in promoting responsible data visualization, I acknowledge that there were areas that could have been approached differently. In hindsight, seeking input from a UX/UI expert with experience in data visualization could have provided valuable insights and further refined the user interface for ethical data representation. Furthermore, creating a culture of responsibility around data visualization within the team could have been emphasized more. Encouraging open discussions about the ethical considerations of data presentation and providing opportunities for team members to share their perspectives would have fostered a more robust ethical framework. This experience highlighted the critical importance of ethical considerations in front-end development, particularly in projects involving data visualization. It reinforced my commitment to approaching user interface design with a strong sense of responsibility, ensuring that data is presented accurately, transparently, and in a manner that serves the best interests of the end-users. </div></div>',2);function M(e,t){return q}const F={},J=(0,u.Z)(F,[["render",M]]);var U=J;const P=(0,n.uE)('<div class="mt-10"><h1 class="text-7xl font-bold text-left">Work Experience Skills</h1></div><div class="p-8 flex flex-col items-center"><div class="mb-5 mt-7 text-center"><h1 class="text-3xl font-bold"> Transferable Skills Aquired During WIL Experience </h1></div><div class="ml-10 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6"><h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">About Me</h1><p class="text-lg mb-4"> During my placement at Gilmour Space, I was immersed in a dynamic environment focused on Vue application development.

Through hands-on projects, I gained a deep understanding of component-based architecture, state management, and routing. This experience expanded my ability to develop responsive and interactive user interfaces, a crucial skill in modern web development. Additionally, I delved into debugging complex code, allowing me to identify and resolve issues efficiently. This refined my problem-solving skills and equipped me with the ability to tackle intricate challenges in a production environment. Moreover, I had the opportunity to engage with Git version control extensively, gaining proficiency in collaborative code management and version tracking. </p></div></div></div><div class="flex items-center"><div class="w-8/12"><div class="pl-4"><p class="mb-4"> Prescribed and Self-Identified Learning: The industry partner provided structured learning on optimising code for performance, which was critical for enhancing the efficiency of our Vue application. Additionally, I identified the need to deepen my knowledge in asynchronous JavaScript and gained proficiency in handling asynchronous operations through asynchronous functions and Promises. The depth and breadth of my learning during this placement were extensive. Not only did I develop a strong foundation in Vue.js, but I also acquired advanced skills in debugging and asynchronous JavaScript as a result. This comprehensive skill set enabled me to contribute effectively to the development team and deliver high-quality code. </p></div></div><div class="w-4/12"><img src="'+G+'"></div></div><div class="flex items-center"><div class="w-4/12"><img src="'+D+'"></div><div class="w-8/12"><div class="pl-4"><p class="mb-4"> Application of Existing Skill Set to a Different Context: This experience represented an application of my existing JavaScript knowledge to a more specialized context. While I had prior experience with JavaScript, the intricacies of Vue.js required a deeper understanding of front-end development. This transition was marked by an increased focus on component-based architecture and reactivity, areas that were more nuanced in Vue.js compared to traditional JavaScript. Approach to Learning: As an undergraduate student, my approach to learning was primarily centered around coursework and theoretical understanding. However, as a post-graduate student and through this placement, my approach evolved to prioritize practical application and hands-on experience. I recognized the significance of continuous learning in staying current with industry trends and emerging technologies. Selected Critical Transferable Skills: Teamwork and Communication Throughout my academic journey, the emphasis on teamwork has transformed from group projects to collaborative coding sessions.
